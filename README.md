### üì¶ Installation

You may wish to update `firebase.ts` with your own Firebase project credentials.

Firestore Database Rules:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write their own UserProfile
    match /UserProfile/{userId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Projects are stored with the user's UID as the document ID
    match /Projects/{userId} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

```python
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UdhayaShan1/AWSketch.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```
